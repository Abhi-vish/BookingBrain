# Sample Test Queries and Expected Answers

## Query 1: Booking Analysis
**Input:** Analyze the booking data for trends in customer preferences.

**Expected Output:** 

***1. SUMMARY ANSWER:***

Based on the provided booking data, customer preferences show a strong inclination towards longer stays (5+ week nights) during September, with a notable number of bookings made through agents 240 and 243.  Cancellation rates are relatively high, particularly for bookings with longer lead times.  


**2. DETAILED ANALYSIS:**

The dataset includes 28 bookings for the Resort Hotel.  Analysis reveals several trends:

* **Lead Time:** Lead times vary significantly, ranging from 0 days to 737 days.  A substantial portion of bookings (approximately 43%) were made with a lead time of less than 100 days. This suggests a mix of last-minute bookings and advance bookings.  Bookings made more than 100 days in advance appear to have a slightly higher cancellation rate.

* **Stay Duration:**  Most bookings are for stays with 5 or more week nights, suggesting a preference for longer vacations. There's a distinct peak in bookings around September,  indicating a potential high season or period of increased demand.

* **Booking Channel:** A significant number of bookings were made through agents 14, 240, and 243.  Further investigation is needed to determine if these agents represent specific travel agencies or online platforms, which could inform marketing strategies.

* **Cancellation Rate:** The cancellation rate is approximately 18% (5/28). Cancellations seem concentrated around the September period suggesting potential factors affecting this high cancellation rate during the peak season, such as pricing, or external events could require analysis.


**3. CONTEXTUAL INSIGHTS:**

* **Seasonality:** A clear peak in bookings is observed during September.  This suggests the hotel should optimize pricing and resource allocation during this period to maximize revenue. Conversely, strategies to fill occupancy during low seasons might be beneficial.


* **Agent Performance:** The high volume of bookings from certain agents (14, 240, and 243) warrants further investigation. Understanding their sales strategies and customer base could provide valuable insights for optimizing marketing efforts.

* **Cancellation Implications:**  The relatively high cancellation rate (18%) impacts revenue and resource management.  Analyzing the reasons for cancellations (e.g., pricing, external factors, policy changes) is critical for improving booking policies and reducing revenue loss.

* **Customer Type:**  Most bookings (82%) are from transient customers, with a small number from transient-party and contract customers. This might influence the hotel's service offerings and marketing campaigns.

**4. DATA LIMITATIONS:**

The analysis is limited by the small sample size (28 bookings) and the short time span covered by the data (approximately 2 years).   The lack of information on cancellation reasons prevents a deeper analysis of the cancellation pattern.  Additionally, geographical data of guests is absent, which would enrich the customer preference analysis.

Confidence in the findings is moderate due to the small sample size, and additional data would significantly improve the accuracy and insights.      


**5. FOLLOW-UP SUGGESTIONS:**

* **Gather data on:**  reasons for cancellation, guest demographics (age, location, etc.), and booking source details (e.g., online travel agencies, direct bookings).

* **Extend the time period:** Increase the timeframe for analysis to reveal more robust seasonal trends and long-term booking patterns.

* **Analyze external factors:** Investigate how macroeconomic conditions, local events, or competitor hotel pricing might influence booking trends and cancellation rates.

* **RevPAR analysis:** Calculate Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) to assess the overall revenue performance over the studied periods, in conjunction with the current data to assess the profitability and impact of booking preferences.

## Query 2: Customer Segmentation
**Input:** Segment customers based on booking behavior.

**Expected Output:** 

***1. SUMMARY ANSWER:***

Customers can be segmented based on cancellation behavior (high vs. low cancellation rates) and booking channel (agent vs. direct).  Further segmentation could be done by customer type (transient vs. group) and lead time (short vs. long).


**2. DETAILED ANALYSIS:**

The provided data allows for segmentation based on cancellation behavior and booking channel.  A more granular segmentation by lead time and customer type would be possible with additional data.

**2.1 Cancellation Behavior:**

* **High Cancellation Rate Segment:**  Of the 20 bookings, 15 were canceled (75%).
* **Low Cancellation Rate Segment:** 5 bookings were not canceled (25%).

**2.2 Booking Channel:**

The data shows bookings made through various agents (Agent ID).  To analyze this properly, we need to understand which Agent IDs represent different booking channels (e.g., online travel agents (OTAs), global distribution systems (GDS), or direct bookings).  The current data doesn't provide this context.  Therefore, the detailed analysis on booking channels is not possible without further information linking Agent IDs to specific booking channels.

**2.3  Lead Time Segmentation (Partial Analysis):**

We can partially analyze lead time by looking at canceled vs. non-canceled bookings.  However, creating meaningful lead-time segments (e.g., short < 30 days, medium 30-90 days, long > 90 days) requires more data points.  The existing data has a wide range of lead times, but the small sample size makes it hard to draw robust conclusions from creating segments.


**2.4 Customer Type Segmentation:**

* **Transient Customers:** 18 bookings were from transient customers. Of these, 12 were canceled (67%).
* **Group Customers:** 1 booking was from a group customer. It was canceled.

**3. CONTEXTUAL INSIGHTS:**

* **High Cancellation Rate:** The high cancellation rate (75%) indicates a potential issue with either pricing, booking policies, or customer expectations that should be investigated.
* **Long Lead Time Cancellations:**  Several bookings with long lead times were canceled, suggesting potential issues with advance bookings or group bookings.
* **Agent Impact (Limited Insight):**  The absence of channel information related to agent IDs prevents a complete analysis of which booking channels are performing better or worse.
* **Price and Cancellation:**  There is no consistent relationship between price and cancellation observable in the data.  Some high-priced bookings were canceled, while some low-priced ones were not.  More data is needed to assess potential correlation.

**4. DATA LIMITATIONS:**

* **Small Sample Size:** The dataset contains only 20 bookings, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions. Larger datasets are needed for more robust analysis.
* **Missing Channel Data:**  Agent IDs need to be mapped to actual booking channels to perform proper channel-based segmentation.
* **Limited Temporal Scope:** The data is only from a limited period. It is impossible to determine seasonality or trend without a longer time frame.

**5. FOLLOW-UP SUGGESTIONS:**

* **Gather more booking data:** A larger dataset covering a longer period will allow for more statistically significant analyses.
* **Link Agent IDs to booking channels:**  This is crucial to analyze booking channel performance.
* **Include additional variables:**  Analyzing factors such as guest demographics (age, origin), room type, and special request types can provide a more detailed customer segmentation.
* **Analyze revenue implications of cancellations:** Calculate the revenue lost due to cancellations to quantify the financial impact.
* **Investigate the reason for cancellation:** Add a column specifying the reason for cancellation to facilitate deeper analysis and identify actionable insights.

## Query 3: Price Prediction
**1. SUMMARY ANSWER:**

Based on the provided data of 27 hotel bookings from the Resort Hotel,  predicting the price of future bookings is challenging due to the limited sample size and lack of information on factors influencing price (e.g., seasonality, room type, demand).  However, the average price observed is €98.66.


**2. DETAILED ANALYSIS:**

* **Data Overview:** The dataset includes 27 bookings from the Resort Hotel with various characteristics including arrival date, lead time, number of guests, customer type, and price.  The data spans several months, encompassing some seasonality.

* **Price Calculation:** The average price per booking is calculated as follows:

   Total Revenue =  Σ(Price of each booking) = €2662.42
   Number of Bookings = 27
   Average Booking Price = Total Revenue / Number of Bookings = €2662.42 / 27 = €98.66


* **Price Distribution:** A more detailed analysis would benefit from a histogram or boxplot showing the distribution of booking prices. This visualization would reveal the range of prices, potential outliers, and the overall shape of the distribution.


* **Segmentation:**  The data can be segmented by various factors to investigate if certain factors correlate with price. For instance:

   * **Customer Type:** Comparing average prices for "transient," "transient-party," and "group" customer types would reveal whether different customer segments have different pricing.
   * **Lead Time:**  Analyzing the relationship between lead time and price would determine if longer lead times command lower or higher prices.     
   * **Seasonality:**  Data from different months could be compared to determine if booking prices vary seasonally.
   * **Weekdays vs. Weekends:** The price difference between weekend and weekday stays could be investigated.


**3. CONTEXTUAL INSIGHTS:**

The average price of €98.66 is a simple average and doesn't account for variations within the dataset. A regression model incorporating factors like seasonality, room type, and demand would provide a far more accurate predictive model. Without additional data, the average provides a limited insight into pricing.  Further analysis, as suggested above, will reveal patterns and significant relationships that could inform dynamic pricing strategies.


**4. DATA LIMITATIONS:**

* **Small Sample Size:** The analysis is based on only 27 bookings, a limited sample size insufficient to establish statistically significant trends or predict future prices with high confidence.  More booking data is necessary for robust analysis.
* **Missing Variables:** The dataset lacks key information such as room type, specific dates of arrival and departure, which are crucial in price determination.  Also missing is information on external factors such as occupancy rate and competitor pricing.
* **Limited Time Span:** The data spans a limited time period; more extensive data would improve the accuracy of any predictions and highlight seasonal fluctuations better.

Confidence Level: Low. The prediction is based on a small and incomplete dataset and should be considered highly preliminary.


**5. FOLLOW-UP SUGGESTIONS:**

* **Gather Additional Data:**  Collect a larger dataset encompassing a wider range of bookings including room type, dates, competitor prices, and occupancy levels.
* **Develop a Predictive Model:** Employ statistical modelling (e.g., regression analysis) incorporating the relevant variables to build a model for accurately predicting booking prices.
* **Analyze Seasonality:**  Further investigate the influence of seasonality on booking prices to determine the high and low seasons.
* **Assess Competitor Pricing:**  Examine the prices of competitor hotels to gauge their impact on pricing strategies.
**Expected Output:** 
- Predicted price range for different hotel types and booking conditions.

## Query 4: Booking Cancellation Rates
**Input:** What are the cancellation rates for different hotels?

**Expected Output:** 

1. **SUMMARY ANSWER:**

Based on the provided data, the cancellation rate for the Resort Hotel is 100%, as all bookings in the dataset for this hotel were cancelled.  This is a significantly high rate and warrants further investigation.


2. **DETAILED ANALYSIS:**

The dataset includes 24 bookings for the Resort Hotel, all of which resulted in cancellations.  Therefore, the cancellation rate is calculated as follows:

* **Total Bookings:** 24
* **Cancelled Bookings:** 24
* **Cancellation Rate:** (Cancelled Bookings / Total Bookings) * 100% = (24/24) * 100% = 100%

The data spans several months in 2015 and the beginning of 2016, showing cancellations across various lead times and arrival dates.  There is no information on bookings that were *not* cancelled to allow calculation of a true cancellation rate.


3. **CONTEXTUAL INSIGHTS:**

A 100% cancellation rate for the Resort Hotel is exceptionally high and suggests serious issues.  Possible contributing factors, which cannot be determined from the current data, include:

* **Pricing Issues:** Are the prices uncompetitive compared to similar hotels?
* **Booking Process Problems:** Are there issues with the online booking system or customer service?
* **Overbooking:**  Is the hotel consistently overbooked, leading to cancellations?
* **External Factors:**  Were there unforeseen events (e.g., natural disasters, economic downturns) affecting bookings?
* **Deposit Policy:**  The high percentage of "non-refund" deposits might be driving cancellations.

Further investigation is needed to understand the underlying reasons for this high cancellation rate.


4. **DATA LIMITATIONS:**

The most significant limitation is the absence of data on completed (non-cancelled) bookings for the Resort Hotel.  This means the cancellation rate is calculated based on a sample of only cancellations and doesn’t reflect the true percentage of bookings cancelled against the total number of bookings received.  This makes the confidence level in the reported 100% cancellation rate low, as it is not a true representation of the overall booking performance.  The data also lacks contextual information to explain *why* these cancellations occurred.


5. **FOLLOW-UP SUGGESTIONS:**

To gain a more comprehensive understanding of cancellation patterns, the following data should be collected and analyzed:

* **Total Number of Bookings:** Include both cancelled and completed bookings to calculate a true cancellation rate.
* **Reasons for Cancellation:**  Gather information on the reasons guests cancelled their bookings (e.g., price changes, unforeseen circumstances, better offers from competitors).
* **Booking Channel Data:**  Analyze cancellation rates across different booking channels (e.g., online travel agents, direct bookings).
* **Guest Feedback:**  Collect guest feedback to identify areas for improvement and understand the reasons for cancellations.
* **Market Data:**  Compare cancellation rates to industry benchmarks for similar hotels in the same location.

By collecting and analyzing this additional information, a more accurate and nuanced understanding of the Resort Hotel's cancellation patterns can be achieved and appropriate strategies to improve booking performance can be implemented.
